        <h2>Basic info about Bali</h2>
        <p>Bali is a province of Indonesia and the westernmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands. East of Java and west of Lombok, the province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller neighbouring islands, notably Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan. The provincial capital, Denpasar, is the most populous city in the Lesser Sunda Islands and the second-largest, after Makassar, in Eastern Indonesia. </p>

        <p>Bali's main attractions are endless rice fields and volcanoes. Well, and Hindu temples - there are so many of them that don't even think about trying to visit them all: it's simply impossible. But let's tell you which temples you shouldn't miss. The Tanax Lot temple is famous for its location: it is located on a small island on the west coast. Thanks, again, to its location, it is impossible to enter the temple, but you can look at it from different points.</p>
