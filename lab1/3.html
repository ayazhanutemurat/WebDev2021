  <h1 class="name">Road Notes from Day Country</h1>
  <p><span class="first-letter">T</span>he John Day River, which zigzags north and west through Oregon's arid middle, is undammed for its entire length. This makes the river a sort of symbolic character to the state - the John Day is free, wild and unpredictable.California's suffering from drought this year was well known around North America, but the effect of the same drought on Oregon went largely unnoticed. In Portland, the drought meant sunny days and a warm winter, but beyond that, it was difficult to discern the real impact.But as you head east from Portland, the visuals of the severity of the drought intensify. First, you see the receding glaciers of Mount Hood, and barren mountain wildflower meadows. As you pass near Warm Springs at the base of Mount Hood, what used to be beautiful desert scrub is now a hundred square miles of scorched earth.This wildfire started when an outsized recreational vehicle drove along Highway 26 on bare rims, causing sparks to fly for a length of six miles.</p>

   <p>Part of what makes the Pacific Northwest drought different is that its impact isn't just due to heat and a lack of rain, per se, but specifically a lack of winter snow, the snowpack of which slowly feeds rivers throughout the year, and which fills the reservoirs throughout the state.

    It was the second warmest year in recorded Oregon history; the streams are trickles, the docks on mountain lakes sit hundreds of yards from puddles of water, and grasslands are brown.
    
    For most of the year, seeing these things in passing, I still didn't really connect the severity of it all. But as we roll into the small city of John Day in late summer, we see it clearly.
    
    John Day has been converted into command central for the historic Canyon Creek Complex wildfire, which is still raging. Fatigued men in National Guard uniforms are everywhere. Fire-fighting trucks are parked in nearly every lot around the center of town. At the grocery store, the clerk tells me that forty homes have been lost, and sixty-seven thousand acres have burned. "Look south when you walk outside," she says. "That massive plume of clouds you see are not clouds."</p>
